# Number-guessing-game:
Welcome to the Guess The Number game!!!
     This project allows users to play a number-guessing game with three difficulty levels:
      easy, medium, and difficult.

Instructions:
The player has to guess a number between 1 and 100 based on levels..
The number of chances is based on the difficulty level chosen by the player.
If the player exhausts all chances without guessing correctly, the game reveals the correct number.

Features:
Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number for the player to guess.
Difficulty Levels:
Easy:   guess number between (1-20) .you have 10 chances to guess.
Medium:   guess number between (1-50) ,you have 7 chances to guess.
Difficult:   guess number between (1-100) you have 5 chances to guess.
User Interaction: The player inputs their guesses, and the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
How to Play?
Clone the repository.
Compile the C++ code.
Run the executable.
Follow the on-screen instructions to select the difficulty level and make your guesses.
Notes
This project is a simple console-based game suitable for learning and practicing basic C++ programming concepts.
Enjoy playing the Guess The Number game!!
THANK YOU

# SIMPLE CALCULATOR:
  * This program is a simple yet versatile console-based calculator written in C++.
  * It supports a range of mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
    Additional operations: square, square root, cube, modulus, exponentiation.
  * The code is designed with modularity, error handling for division by zero and modulus by zero.
  * Clean and modular design with a class-based structure.
  * Ideal for learning and practicing C++ programming, especially for beginners
  * User-friendly menu display and input validation.

Design:

Class-Based Structure:
    The calculator functionality is encapsulated within the Calculator class.

Switch-Case Statement:
   The main program uses a switch-case statement to determine the user's choice and execute the corresponding operation.

Private Helper Methods:
    Mathematical operations are implemented as private methods within the class, promoting encapsulation and code organization.

Menu Display Method:
    The displayMenu() method is responsible for displaying the menu to the user.

Input Validation:
     The program includes input validation to handle invalid choices from the user.

Error Handling:
     Division by zero is handled with an appropriate error message.
Modulus by zero is handled with an error message.

Looping Mechanism:
    The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit (option 10).

Output Formatting:
     The program provides clear and formatted output for the results of each operation.

Graceful Exit:
     The program exits gracefully with a thank-you message when the user chooses to exit.

                 THANK YOU !!!
